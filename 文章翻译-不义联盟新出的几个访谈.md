这个画风超~毁~的，很多人反映认不出那个是大米……

我认出来了都不好意思说。

然而老爷还是很美貌啊：

当然要承认上色师的贡献，但因为这么一帧，我也实在不能说这期画师不行。

## 疑问

来继续补几刀。

以下摘自多篇访谈：

### 老爷为什么要动摇？

> 布鲁斯：如果只是我太过顽固呢？我不能否认，这个世界自从五年前以来变得更加安全了，因为超人--
>
> 阿尔弗雷德：是个杀人凶手。

**GameSpot: Where does Batman stand on his fight against Superman? Is he reconsidering his viewpoint?**

**Brian Buccellato:** I don't think he's reconsidering so much as it's just a moment of doubt. I don't think he'd seriously reconsider it. Batman's been pretty clear on how he feels about what Superman and the Regime are doing. He has that very very distinct line he won't cross. I think it's more he's just showing a little bit of self doubt.

**编剧：**他没有动摇，只是显露了一点自我怀疑。



### 阿福为什么一定要留在韦恩庄园？

**Is Alfred just stubborn by sticking around Wayne Manor despite the world knowing who Batman is?**

Yeah. Who, in their right mind, would go after Alfred? I don't think anyone other than Superman or Zsasz or someone like that would try to go after him. Also, he's been around the block a lot. He can take care of himself. He's lived a long life, and he's not going to run. Alfred is the keeper of Wayne Manor. He ain't leaving. He's like the captain that goes down with the ship.

**编剧：**他能照顾自己。他不会逃避。他是韦恩庄园的守护者。



### 为什么是萨斯？

**Nrama**: Why Victor Zsasz as the one to kill Alfred?

**Buccellato**: In Page one of this chapter, Superman basically sent him to do his bidding. It's a calculated choice by Superman, because Victor Zsasz is a homicidal maniac, and just sending Zsasz to the Batcave to get information from Alfred, he knows how it's going to end. He knows Alfred's not going to give it up.

It's a way of putting a hit on somebody without doing it.

So in some ways it's Clark justifying it to himself. It's pretty twisted, but to me, it seemed like a natural fit.

And Zsasz isn't some giant behemoth who's going to come squash Alfred. He's formidable, obviously, but Alfred's got some skills. So I thought it would be a pretty good battle.

**编剧：**超人借刀杀人。而且阿福有能力和萨斯打一场。



### 老爷会滑向黑暗吗？

**MP: So with Alfred gone, are we going to see a much darker or more brutal Batman than what we're used to? Is this going to be his breaking point?**

**BB:** I don't think so. I think that Batman acts true to who he is, and the line in the sand that was drawn from the beginning of this universe — with Batman on one side and Superman on the other — is very clear. It's very clear where that line is drawn. I think he's going to go to the edge, but I don't see him being that dark. It's a very painful storyline, it affects him as well as everyone around him. But I don't think it's going to push him to be way darker.

**编剧：**他不会。他会到极限，但不会更黑暗。



### 为什么杀阿福？

**MP: So tell us about this storyline, the death of Alfred — it's a very huge storyline. Alfred is a very important character to both Batman and the DC Universe. What was going on in your head while you were creating this story?**

**BB:** For me, it was about exploring how Bruce Wayne would deal with similar circumstances [to Clark Kent]. We saw how Superman responded to Lois and his unborn child being killed, and Metropolis being nuked. It made him into a murderer, you know? He killed the Joker. I really wanted to put Batman in a situation where he'd have to face the same challenge. Alfred is by far his family. Losing Alfred to such an act of violence is, I mean, if there was ever something to push Batman to the edge, this is it.

**编剧：**他现在和克拉克当初境遇相似。克拉克因此成了杀人凶手；他会因此被逼到极限。



### 这么做感觉怎样？

**How does it feel being responsible for Alfred's murder? Do you feel like a big jerk now?**

I feel like a huge jerk. I feel like the biggest kind of jerk there is. I feel like a Superman-size jerk. When I thought of the idea for the storyline and how Alfred would pass, it opened up a lot of opportunities because he's all the family Bruce has. I felt like it'd be a great way to exploit a situation with Bruce that Clark faced. That's what started the entire *Injustice* universe. In doing so, it is kind of sad. I probably won't ever kill him again.

**编剧：**我。是。个。超。级。大。混。蛋。



### 最爱的人物？

**MP: So who would you say is your favorite character in theInjustice storyline?**

**BB:** Hmm. It's kind of a cop-out to say Harley, she's definitely the most fun to write, because she's so unpredictable. I have the most fun writing her. But as far as who my favorite character is — probably still Batman. I'm a big fan of Superman, but not in this universe, since he's such a jerk [laughs]. I also love Barry Allen — the Flash — but in this world, he's made too many compromises.

**编剧：**蝙蝠侠。目前依然。



### 写完没？

**Do you have the final chapter mapped out?**

Yeah, we have the rest of the chapters mapped out. They're not all written, but they're definitely mapped out. I know what happens, and I know how it ends. Hopefully people will like it. Hopefully *you'll* like it.

**编剧：**写完了大纲，没写完剧本。



### 原编剧的反应？

**原编剧：**“我知道他的打算。你们快咆哮吧。”

![](/Users/alicewish/Pictures/屏幕快照 2016-05-26 上午2.22.53.png)

**现编剧：**“意思是你很开心？”

**原编剧：**“是的我很开心。真粉也会开心。别管他们怎么说。”



### 我？

之前封面预告和剧情简介透光了好伐。而且画风敢好一点么……

真粉免鉴，单期+合订均收。我可能神话了汤姆·泰勒，但布莱恩真的不怎么对我胃口。他所谓的最自豪的部分，哈莉的自我治疗，道德上没什么说服力。

便当是爆点，但重点用不着聚集在便当上。用换编剧后一半的便当量写出加倍的情感爆发和冲突，我都自觉可以做到诶……

真希望过个几年能在DC一较高下。
